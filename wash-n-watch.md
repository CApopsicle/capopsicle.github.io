## Wash-N-Watch
#### The Girl’s dorm washing machine monitoring and notifying system

### The Problem
University dorms are not an ideal place for living, there are no private bedrooms, the insulation is pretty bad, and there's a limited amount of house appliances. In NTU girl's dorm, we had 100 girls using only 2 washing machines. Washing clothes is a painful experience. 

From this user pain point, comes this project of designing and implementation of a monitoring system for washing machines in NTU girl's dorm. Our system aims to display the status of every washing machine in the girl's dorm. We enabled sign-in, subscription, and text message notification for users. A user of our service can subscribe to a certain washing machine on our webpage, and she can get a text notification when that machine finishes its washing schedule.
