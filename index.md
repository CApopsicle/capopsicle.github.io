Hello, I am Kelly.
Having an aspiration to be a hybrid of an engineer and a designer, I create innovative products and tools with good usability to empower people.

I got my Master's degree in computer science at Georgia Tech, graduated in 2020, specialized in human-computer interaction. 

I love being creative, making creations from 0 to 1 on my own, and coding. Working closely with designers, I love interface development the most. I had experiences working as a frontend engineer with substantial knowledge about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and I like challenging myself to build interfaces with complex user interactions and manipulations.

My current career focus is full-stack and front-end, and I'm now under an H1B visa.
