Hello, I am Kelly.
I am a master student at Georgia Tech, majoring in computer science, specializing in human-computer interaction. 

My aspiration is to become a master in both design and engineering field. I love being creative, making creations from 0 to 1 on my own, and coding. Working closely with designers, I love interface development the most. I had experiences working as a frontend engineer with substantial knowledge about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and I like challenging myself to build interfaces with complex user interactions and manipulations.
